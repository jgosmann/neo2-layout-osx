# neo2-layout-osx
Neo2 keyboard layout file for macOS.

This is based on the file provided by [neo-layout.org](http://neo-layout.org/),
but has a number of improvements:

* Improved caps lock layout: Top row still provides the numbers (special symbols
  require shift in addition to caps lock), letters are switched to lowercase
  when <kbd>shift</kbd> is pressed, allow to type layer 3 symbols with
  <kbd>mod 3</kbd> when caps lock is active.
* Fixes to the handling of <kbd>M3</kbd>+<kbd>Cmd</kbd> to increase
  compatibility with shortcuts (though, shortcuts involving <kbd>M3</kbd> can 
  still be problematic and will remain so for the foreseeable future).
* A few unassigned keys in the layout have been fixed.
* Fixed layer 4 minus.
* Fixed the layout of the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> modifier to work in MacVim.
* Fixed compose function for Ã±.
* Fixed <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd>.
* Alternative icons that can be used with the new dark mode in macOS Mojave.

# Installation

1. Copy `neo.keylayout` and one of the icons (`neo*.icns`) renamed to `neo.icns`
   to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` (user install) or
   `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` (system-wide install).
2. Reboot.
3. Add "Deutsch (Neo 2)" in the Input Sources tab of the Keyboard system
   settings.

To get access to all layers, also install [Karabiner
Elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) and import [the Neo2 complex rule
set](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/complex_modifications/#neo2). Activate the
desired complex rules (probably you want at least "Neo2 layer 4", "Neo2 layer
6", and one of the "Neo2 mod 3 and 4 keys" rules).

# Know issues

* Some programs (often webbrowsers or webpages displayed in them) might
  interpret layer 3 keys as a shortcut. You can use one of the "Prevent *keys*
  from being treated as option key shortcut" rules in Karabiner Elements to
  prevent this.
* When using one of the "Prevent *keys* from being treated as option key
  shortcut" rules in Karabiner Elements, those keys will produce an additional
  character in JetBrains IDE. This issue has been reported
  [upstream](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/JBR-1311?_ga=2.179409447.2093995893.1567764984-747787643.1539369234).
  As a workaround, open **Help | Edit Custom Properties**, add
  `com.jetbrains.use.old.keyevent.processing=true` and restart the IDE.
